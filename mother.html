        "Me and My Mother" is an ongoing video series by Ragnar Kjartansson that
        started in 2000 and has continued at five-year intervals. The work
        captures interactions between the artist and his mother, Guðrún
        Ásmundsdóttir, in their living room. In each iteration, his mother
        repeatedly spits on him while both maintain mostly straight faces. It’s
        an arresting study of familial relations, repetition, and the passage of
        time, with each version revealing subtle shifts in emotion and context.

        This piece explores the complex psychological dynamics of the mother-son
        relationship in a manner that’s both humorous and deeply poignant. Each
        successive iteration not only adds layers of meaning but also documents
        the aging process, offering an emotional and biological chronicle that’s
        rare in contemporary art.

        "Me and My Mother" has been exhibited globally and is frequently cited
        in discussions about Kjartansson’s oeuvre. The work offers an intimate
        look into themes recurrent in his art—endurance, repetition, and the
        stretching of a single moment into an extended experience. For deeper
        perspectives, academic articles and museum catalogues often delve into
        the layers of this fascinating series.
