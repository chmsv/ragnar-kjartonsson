        Created in 2012, this multi-channel video installation has been
        described as an emotional tour de force. Set in a crumbling mansion in
        upstate New York, the piece gathers a group of musicians, each situated
        in different rooms of the house, and even outside in a field. Each
        performer is captured in a separate video channel, and they’re all
        networked together to play the same song in a synchronous yet dispersed
        fashion.
      </p>

        The title, "The Visitors," is inspired by ABBA’s last album, and the
        piece is a meditation on friendship, sorrow, and the artistic process.
        Kjartansson himself participates, strumming a guitar in a bathtub. As
        viewers wander through the installation space, they’re enveloped by the
        individual yet collective music-making, experiencing both isolation and
        togetherness. The entire performance lasts a bit over an hour, with the
        musicians eventually gathering to leave the house together, instruments
        in tow, which wraps it up on a poignant note.

        The artwork has been exhibited at numerous venues globally, including
        the Broad Museum in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New
        York. It’s a must-see if you’re diving into Kjartansson’s world; it
        encapsulates many of his recurring themes — melancholy, duration, and
        the blending of performance and visual art.
