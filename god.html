        "God" is a captivating video installation by Ragnar Kjartansson, created
        in 2007. The work features the artist himself as a crooning lounge
        singer, dressed in a tuxedo and accompanied by an orchestra. Set against
        the backdrop of an opulent theater, Kjartansson performs a melancholic
        tune with the repeating lyric, "Sorrow conquers happiness." The
        performance is a loop, allowing viewers to enter and exit at any point,
        thus experiencing the perpetual ebb and flow of emotion encapsulated in
        the phrase.

        The installation presents a rich tapestry of influences and references,
        from theater and opera to the tradition of the tragicomic. Kjartansson’s
        repetitive use of a single lyric brings forth multiple interpretations,
        each changing with repeated viewing. The phrase itself becomes a mantra,
        turning the piece into a meditative exploration of existential themes.

        As with many of Kjartansson’s works, "God" draws upon the artist’s
        fascination with duration and repetition, using them as tools to delve
        into the complexities of human emotion. The work has garnered attention
        in various exhibitions and has been analyzed in academic discourse for
        its intricate layering of art forms and emotional states.

        This performance was adapted in Russian and performed in 2014 (in
        Saint-Petersburg) and 2019 (in Moscow).
