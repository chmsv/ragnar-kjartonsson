        "A Lot of Sorrow" is another captivating piece by Ragnar Kjartansson, a
        collaboration with the American indie rock band The National. The
        performance took place in 2013 at MoMA PS1 in New York. The premise is
        as intriguing as it is simple: The National performs their song "Sorrow"
        repeatedly for six hours straight. Six hours of one song, over and over
        again.

        This isn’t just a test of endurance for the musicians; it’s an
        exploration of emotion, repetition, and the transformative power of art.
        As the hours pass, the song takes on new shades of meaning for both the
        performers and the audience. The repetition turns the specific sorrow
        described in the song into something universal, almost meditative.

        It’s a perfect example of Kjartansson’s fascination with durational
        performance and how time can alter or deepen our emotional and aesthetic
        experiences.
